  The Office of Inspector General (OIG) serves as a watchdog agency for the WAX Network. It acts as a neutral third-party designated to evaluate WAX Guild Candidatesâ€™ contribution to the ecosystem and provide ongoing transparency for the community. The Office of Inspector General is a committee with three members who standardize WAX Guild evaluations and properly recognize WAX Guild Candidates making valuable contributions to the WAX ecosystem. The committee members (IGs) are elected individually from and by the community, contributing to further decentralizing the WAX Network.
</p>
<p align="center">
The IGs collaborate to handle the responsibilities of the office, issuing detailed criteria, evaluation parameters, scoring mechanisms, and educating the community about governance on WAX.
